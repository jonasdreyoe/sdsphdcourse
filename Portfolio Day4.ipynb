They write:\n","\n","We built an artificial intelligence model by fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate tweets in the style of Donald Trump’s Twitter account. After seeing the results, we also built a discriminator that can accurately detect fake tweets 77% of the time — think you can beat our classifier? Try it yourself!\n","\n","GPT-2 is a neural transformer-based model, that has been announced by OpenAI in February 2019 and created considerable discussion because they decided - in contrast to their earlier policies - not to release the mode to the public. Their central argument was that the model could be used to produce fake news, spam and alike too easily. The footnote of the faketrump page reads: “Generating realistic fake text has become much more accessible. We hope to highlight the current state of text generation to demonstrate how difficult it is to discern fiction from reality.”\n","\n","Since then several organizations and researchers have shown that it is possible to develop systems to detect “fake text”. We believe that you too can implement a competitive system.\n","\n","This assignment is not about Natural Language Processing (NLP) but about being able to deal with sequential data using deep learning. Some basic knowledge from M2 can be useful to squeeze the last 1% performance but you should be able to get great results with pure Keras.
